Requirements

Functional Requirements

Homepage displays all posts in reverse chronological order (newest first) with full content.

Each post is a separate .md file stored locally.

Filenames define the post date automatically: YYYY-MM-DD-title.md.

Script converts .md files to .html and updates the homepage.

Minimal HTML: no CSS, no JavaScript, plain text only.

URLs mirror filenames: e.g., /2025-08-20-post-title.html.

Automatic GitHub Pages deployment on push using GitHub Actions.

No RSS/Atom feed, no previous/next navigation.

Non-functional Requirements

Minimal dependencies: only necessary libraries to convert Markdown to HTML (e.g., Python markdown module or Node marked).

Single script for .md â†’ .html conversion and homepage generation.

Fully static output; no server-side processing.
